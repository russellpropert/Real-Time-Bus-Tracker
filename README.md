# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
This project tracks the route 1 MBTA busses that travel Mass Ave in Boston and Cambridge. The page displays one marker per bus and updates every 15 seconds. The bus locations are derived from real time data pulled from [https://api-v3.mbta.com](https://api-v3.mbta.com).

## How To Run
Fork the repository, clone it to your machine, and dragging the index.html file into your browser window. The exercise can also be run fromÂ [here](https://russellpropert.github.io/real-time-bus-tracker/index.html).

## Future Improvements
Adding some bus icons to replace the generic markers and displaying the bus numbers above the icons.
